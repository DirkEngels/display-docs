# Admin

The admin is build without the following, that therefore need to be installed afterwards: 
 - [Templates](https://github.com/os2display/display-docs/blob/main/feeds.md])
 - [Layouts](https://github.com/os2display/display-docs/blob/main/layouts.md)
 - [Feeds](https://github.com/os2display/display-docs/blob/main/feeds.md])
 - [Themes](https://github.com/os2display/display-templates/tree/develop/src/themes]) NB: is put in through editor unlike the above.

Please also look at the readme for structure between elements in the admin.
