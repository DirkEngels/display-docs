# Admin

The admin is build without the following, that therefore need to be installed afterwards: 
 - [Templates](../content_structure/templates)
 - [Layouts](../content_structure/layouts)
 - [Feeds](../content_structure/feeds)
 - [Themes](../content_structure/themes)

Please also look at the readme for structure between elements in the admin.

## Create users manually
